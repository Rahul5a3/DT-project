    <font face="Times New Roman" size="5">
    <p>Bachelor of Technology (BTech) is a professional undergraduate engineering degree programme
      awarded to candidates after they complete four years of study in the field.
      Engineering is one of the most popular courses in India and there are many
      institutes that offer the course to aspiring students.</p>

      </center>
      <p>After completing the B.Tech course candidates can either pursue higher studies example:GATE or consider pursuing a job after B.Tech
       in the field of their choice. Although <a href="https://collegevidya.com/blog/what-is-the-full-form-of-mtech-master-of-technology/" target="_blank">
       M.Tech</a> is a natural course choice after completing a B.Tech course, these days many students opt to take up an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration" target="_blank">
       MBA course</a> after completing their B. Tech degree program.</p>

       </div>
       <p>college placements also known as campus recruitment, is when companies come to your colleges campus, conduct interviews,
         and hire candidates to work in their company. These campus placements are arranged for by your college who
         invite all the best possible companies to recruit from their students. The campus placements are held before the final examination.</p>
      <p><b><u>Students who want to take part in Campus Placements should keep following points in mind:</u></b></p>
      <ul type="cirle">
        <li>Keep your <a href="https://zety.com/blog/how-to-make-a-resume" target="_blank">resume</a> ready and up-to-date.</li>
        <li>Maintain Good score in Academics.</li>
        <li>Actively participate in Extracirrcular Activities.</li>
        <li>Be well-aware of what all you did in your B.Tech project.</li>
        <li>Do proper research and study about the companies you are applying for.</li>

        <p>A gradual transition from BTech to MTech is most popular option that engineering students explore as a course to do
          after engineering. Masters in Technology focuses deeply on the subjects taught during the under-graduation period.
          Students take up streams in which they have pursued their B. Tech to get a well-paying job in their desired field.
          The GATE examination is a must to get through to college offering an M.Tech degree. An M.Tech degree is achievable while
          doing a job too.</p>

          <p>A natural and a well-chosen option, students mostly prefer doing Master of Science in their choice of specialisation,
            after their engineering. Students who have a preference for the technical aspects of things, opt for this course.
            The advantage in doing an M.S. is that other courses require certain years of work experience but there is no such
            requirement for doing an M.S. Doing your M.S. from abroad might speed up your chances to get a job outside the country.
            Getting a good score on your exams like GRE,IELTS,TOEFL,BEC should get you through to your dream college.

              <h4>3.<u><b>Entrepreneurship</b></u>:</h4>
          </div>
          <p>Entrepreneurship is the creation or extraction of value.With this definition, entrepreneurship is viewed as change,
            generally entailing risk beyond what is normally encountered in starting a business, which may include other values
            than simply economic ones.
          </p>
          <p>An entrepreneur is an individual who creates a new business, bearing most of the risks and enjoying most of the rewards.
            The process of setting up a business is known as entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator,
            a source of new ideas, goods, services, and business or procedures.
          </p>
          <p>Nowadays, the success of many startups inspires many engineers to set up their own businesses. As an engineer entrepreneur,
            you will have the freedom to express your creativity and ideas. Since this path might be full of a lot of challenges, it is
            recommended that you check the positives and negative sides of it very carefully before you choose this option.

            <h4>4.<u><b>Civil Services</b></u>:</h4>
          </div>
          <p>The civil service is a collective term for a sector of government composed mainly of career civil servants hired on professional
            merit rather than appointed or elected, whose institutional tenure typically survives transitions of political leadership. A civil
            servant, also known as public servant, is a person employed in the public sector by a government department or agency for public
            sector undertakings. Civil servants work for central and state governments, and answer to the government, not a political party.
